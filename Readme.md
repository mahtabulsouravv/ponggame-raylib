# 🏓 Pong Game using Raylib (C++)  

Since I've learned **C++** and its **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, I decided to apply them in game development. This project showcases **Encapsulation**, **Single Inheritance**, and **Divide and Conquer Algorithm**, along with key game development concepts like **game loops, collision detection, and AI mechanics**.  

## ✨ Features  

◽ **Classic Pong Gameplay**: Enjoy a nostalgic experience with smooth paddle and ball mechanics.  
◽ **AI-Powered Opponent**: A challenging CPU paddle that dynamically moves based on ball position.  
◽ **Realistic Ball Physics**: Ball bounces off walls and paddles with proper collision detection.  
◽ **Score System**: Tracks points for both players and resets the ball after each score.  
◽ **Minimalist UI**: Simple yet engaging interface for a clean gaming experience.  
◽ **Optimized Game Loop**: Ensures smooth rendering and efficient performance.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

◽ **C++**: Core programming language.  
◽ **Raylib**: Lightweight and easy-to-use game development library.
